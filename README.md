# UFOs
Using Javascript, html, and css to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

## Purpose
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Overview

#### TASK

Create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array, or list. This table should have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria, using the Javascript language.

#### APPROACH

First, build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, then create filters to make this table fully dynamic, that is the table should react to user input. Next, place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Finally, customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that allows users to interact with the visualizations.

Challenge Additionally, include five filters in the table (Date, City, State, Country, Shape) using Javascript functions. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Summary
One drawback:
- One Drawback of this webpage is that you need to know what information is available for search.

Further Development:
- A drop down list could be added to be able to filter down the results.
- Data is only available from 2010, which renders the capability to search by year useless. If you could add additional data from other years it could be useful
